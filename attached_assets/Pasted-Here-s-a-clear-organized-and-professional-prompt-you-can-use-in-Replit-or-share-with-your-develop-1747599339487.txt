Here's a clear, organized, and professional prompt you can use in Replit (or share with your developer/team) to guide the implementation of all your requested features and fixes:

### üõ†Ô∏è Replit Development Request: Application Fixes & Feature Enhancements

Please address the following issues and feature requests in our application, organized by section:

---

#### **1. UI Enhancement on Login Page**

Ensure that the following block of code appears inline with the rest of the user experience on the login page. This section introduces the app title, description, and features:

```tsx
<div data-replit-metadata="client/src/pages/auth-page.tsx:323:8" data-component-name="div" class="flex flex-1 flex-col items-center justify-center bg-primary text-primary-foreground p-6 md:w-1/2">
  <div class="text-center max-w-lg">
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">appTitle</h1>
    <p class="text-xl mb-6">appDescription</p>
    <div class="space-y-4">
      <div class="flex items-center space-x-2">
        <div class="bg-primary-foreground text-primary w-8 h-8 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center">1</div>
        <p>feature1</p>
      </div>
      <div class="flex items-center space-x-2">
        <div class="bg-primary-foreground text-primary w-8 h-8 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center">2</div>
        <p>feature2</p>
      </div>
      <div class="flex items-center space-x-2">
        <div class="bg-primary-foreground text-primary w-8 h-8 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center">3</div>
        <p>feature3</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

This section should display cleanly, consistently, and responsively across devices.

#### **2. Manual Meal Entry Section**

Please populate this section with **the 100 most popular and widely known meals**, making them accessible for quick manual entry. Use standard naming conventions and categorize where applicable (e.g., grains, proteins, vegetables).

---

#### **3. Audio Pronunciation Logic (Meal Analysis)**

The current audio output includes the ingredient name in Arabic and English **but excludes calorie and percentage information**, which is incorrect.

üîÑ **Update logic as follows:**

* Only pronounce: **ingredient name + its percentage**
* Omit: calories or repeated dual-language naming unless essential

---

#### **4. Meal Log Functionality**

The **meal log is currently not saving meals correctly** or functioning as expected.

‚úÖ Please fix this functionality so that:

* Meals added are logged reliably
* Entries persist across sessions
* Users can view, edit, or delete logged meals

---

#### **5. Meal Component Analysis Accuracy**

Meal component analysis (e.g., for items like carrots or rice) currently outputs **a single, repeated sentence**, making results unreliable.

üéØ Update analysis logic to:

* Reflect unique, detailed nutrition insights per ingredient
* Vary sentence structure and content to enhance readability and accuracy

---

#### **6. Feature Additions**

‚úÖ **A. Chat Log Panel**

* Implement a **chat history** section where users can view previous interactions and analysis results.

‚úÖ **B. Special Needs Audio Option**

* On the **registration page**, add a toggle or checkbox:

  * Label: **"Do you have special needs?"**
  * If selected:

    * Automatically enable full audio feedback during meal analysis
  * If not selected:

    * Audio is **only played when the user clicks** a ‚ÄúPronounce‚Äù button

---

Let me know if you need the prompt translated into Arabic or formatted as a GitHub issue/ticket.
