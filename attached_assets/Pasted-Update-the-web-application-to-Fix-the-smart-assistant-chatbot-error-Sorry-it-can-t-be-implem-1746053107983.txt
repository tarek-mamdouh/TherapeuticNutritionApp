Update the web application to:
- Fix the smart assistant (chatbot) error ("Sorry, it can't be implemented").
- Add account creation and login functionality.
- Improve image recognition accuracy.
- Implement automatic sending of recorded messages without pressing a send button.
- Verify consistent food recognition.
- Add automatic pronunciation of meal names after image recognition.
## Issues to Address
1. Smart Assistant (Chatbot) Error:
   - Current Issue: Returns "Sorry, it can't be implemented" error.
   - Action:
     - Debug /chat endpoint in FastAPI and client-side logic.
     - Verify SQLite Q&A database or external service (e.g., Dialogflow).
     - Test with sample queries (e.g., "Can I eat bananas?").
     - Log errors in Replit console; provide fallback response.

2. Inaccurate Image Recognition:
   - Current Issue: Produces different and strange results.
   - Action:
     - Retrain AI model with diverse dataset (Food-101 + custom foods).
     - Fine-tune for >85% accuracy.
     - Ensure consistent preprocessing (resize to 224x224, normalize).
     - Test with 50 sample images; log results.
     - Check /predict endpoint for correct model loading.

3. Consistent Food Recognition:
   - Current Status: Produces same result every time.
   - Action:
     - Verify with 10 repeated uploads of same image.
     - Ensure deterministic model and preprocessing.

## New Features
1. Account Creation and Login:
   - Implement authentication:
     - Sign-Up: Collect username, email, password, diabetes type.
     - Login: Authenticate with email/password.
     - Store credentials in SQLite (hashed with bcrypt) or Firebase Auth.
     - Add FastAPI endpoints: POST /signup, POST /login, GET /profile (JWT-protected).
     - Create React Sign-Up/Login pages with accessible forms (ARIA, keyboard navigation).
     - Use JWT in localStorage or HTTP-only cookies.

2. Automatic Sending of Recorded Messages:
   - After voice recording completes (via Web Speech API):
     - Automatically send the recorded message to the chatbot without pressing a send button.
     - Update React chatbot component to detect recording end and trigger API call to /chat.
     - Test with 10 voice inputs; ensure seamless submission.

3. Automatic Meal Name Pronunciation:
   - After image recognition:
     - Automatically trigger TTS to pronounce meal name(s) and suitability (e.g., "Pizza, not suitable").
     - Use Web Speech API for Arabic/English.
     - Add toggle in settings to disable.
     - Test integration with recognition results.

## Deliverables
1. React Web App:
   - Fix chatbot, add Sign-Up/Login, auto-send recorded messages, auto-pronunciation.
   - Update Chatbot.jsx, ImageUpload.jsx, add Signup.jsx, Login.jsx.
2. Backend:
   - Fix /chat, improve /predict, add /signup, /login, /profile.
3. AI Model:
   - Retrained model with >85% accuracy.
4. Documentation:
   - Update setup, code overview, API docs, model docs, user guide, troubleshooting.

## Implementation Steps
1. Debug chatbot error; fix /chat endpoint and Web Speech API.
2. Retrain AI model; test accuracy with 50 images.
3. Verify food recognition consistency with 10 uploads.
4. Add signup/login with FastAPI endpoints and React pages.
5. Implement auto-send for recorded messages in chatbot.
6. Add auto-pronunciation after image recognition.
7. Test all features; update documentation.

## Constraints
- Run within Replitâ€™s resource limits.
- Ensure offline support (localStorage, cached responses).
- Maintain accessibility (ARIA, high-contrast, keyboard navigation).
- Arabic primary; robust RTL/voice support.
- Test on Chrome/Firefox.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Chatbot works without errors (>90% relevance).
- Image recognition >85% accurate.
- Food recognition consistent.
- Signup/login works for 5+ accounts.
- Recorded messages auto-send.
- Auto-pronunciation triggers after recognition.
- App accessible and documented.
